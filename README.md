# SENG560-Assignmen-2

This is a class project for SENG 560. 
The requirements were to create an application to reuse a classmates library in a program. 
The library, was a reusable library that implements basic arithmetic functions. 
and provide these operations on integers and floating-point numbers as well as numbers provided in octal, binary, and hexadecimal. 
The operations to be supported are: 

•	Addition 
•	Subtraction 
•	Multiplication 
•	Division 
•	Square Root 
•	Exponent 
•	Conversion between the various types (octal, hexadecimal, integer, binary).

I have reuse this library in Basic_Calculator window based form for basic arithmetic functions.  
I use The “white box” reuse code to updated GUI was in the implementation in package. The original test program is 
being reused “black box” code with the updated GUI implementation.
