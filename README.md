# SENG560-Assignmen-2

This is a class project for SENG 560 (Basic_calculator Window from). 
The requirements were to create an application to reuse a classmates library in a program. 
The library, was a reusable library that implements basic arithmetic functions. 
and provide these operations on integers and floating-point numbers as well as numbers provided in octal, binary, and hexadecimal. 
The operations to be supported are: 

•	Addition 
•	Subtraction 
•	Multiplication 
•	Division 
•	Square Root 
•	Exponent 
•	Conversion between the various types (octal, hexadecimal, integer, binary).

I have reuse this library in Basic_Calculator window from for basic arithmetic functions.  
I use The # “white box” # reuse code to updated GUI was in the implementation in package. 
The Basic_calculator program is being reused “black box” code with the updated GUI implementation.

# Arithmetic Library

This application uses the third party Java library to perform the basic arithmetic functions for my Basic_calculator Window from. The library obtained from github repository https://github.com/swampy2b/calculator.

Why chose this library:
- The library was well stretchered and good organized. 
- it uses Java so it was easy for me to converted Jave code to C# which I use for my calculator.
- Easy to integrate and also because it uses a POM based project structure which makes it really easy.

# How to run the application

To run the application, download this project and open visule stude and add the project or add Form1 and all classis and run the application.

Note: the code wirh C# so you can work in Eclipse, NetBeans.

# Experience working with reuse library 

I like the idea of reuse, it was very easy to work with. and the documentation provided in the README.md on the GitHub site make it more easy, and explained all methods handled numeric bases as well as decimal and floating numbers.

So I was able to use this library in a "with-box" reuse and did do some modifications in the code of the library. becuase my projram was written in C#, so first I covert the code from Jave to C# and then import the math Class to my program and send the vaiuse through mt form functions.
